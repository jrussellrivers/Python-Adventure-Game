# Python Advnture Gam
Python project for DigitalCrafts

## Assignment
After only two weeks in the program, we were assigned the task of making a game with just Python. This was my first ever coding project and is something I like to look back at to remind me where I started.

## Game Overview
The entire game is just console based and can be played by running main.py. I wrote the game using Python objects and classes in order to make it easier to add additional enemies, items, etc...
My biggest struggle was coming up with a 'map' system. The current solution works for this small game however if I were to ever add onto this idea, I would rewrite it.
